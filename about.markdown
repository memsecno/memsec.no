Scandinavian computer security blog, made to write and detail offensive activities within the security realm, focusing on assessments and investigations of software vulnerabilities, bugs and weaknesses to dedicated design and implementation of exploits utilizing one or more vulnerabilities.

 
This includes activities such as
application fuzzing, binary analysis, software reverse engineering and exploit development. 

Our focus area is the process of making reliable proof-of-concept exploits based on vulnerabilities and weaknesses made possible by existing software-implementation flaws.

All writings and posts is meant for learning and educationial purposes only, and to increase awareness about computer security.
