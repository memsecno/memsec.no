#### Brief
To perform an SSA you need to set a scope for the target of evaluation. Assessing an automobile, a boat or a drone, can be done in different states of a systems lifecycle.
Examples could be the development environment where the target is being designed and made.
A logistics phase, where the ToE, its parts or subsystems is being transported for final assembly or deployment. As a  deployed system in active use, or when the system nears its retirement and/or disposal phase.

Different states for a system may introduce different threats, and a change in system configuration can  expose attack surfaces more easily exploitable by an adversary.
