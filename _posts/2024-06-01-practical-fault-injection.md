### Introduction
Lately, I've been interested in fault injection attacks, and the Hardware Hacking Handbook [1] has been valuable for learning about them. I decided to try out one of the practical examples showcased in the book, and we will take a look at that experiment in this blog post. \\ The experiment is based on that a cheap BBQ ligher can be used to create a spark including electromagnetic field in near vicinity of the microcontroller such that the field interferes with the microcontroller, causing unexpected behvior such as skipping instructions. In practice, this means that we place the BBQ ligher leads on top of the ATMEGA328P SMD package and make sparks.

### Target: ATMEGA328P microcontroller.
The target is an ATMEGA 328P microcontroller in a SMD package, used by the Arduino Nano development board, which is a popular development board for educational and hobbyist purposes. To determine if a fault has been successfully induced in the microcontroller, we use a nested loop and print a count variable that should behave predictably under normal operation. If a fault occurs, the count variable may not produce the expected value, indicating that a fault has occurred.

The following code [1] was uploaded to the microcontroller:
``` cpp
void setup() {
  // Initialize the serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// Declare a global variable to keep count of iterations
unsigned long cnt = 0;
// Declare a global variable to keep track of loop executions
unsigned int loopcnt = 0;

void loop() {
  // Reset cnt to 0 at the start of each loop
  cnt = 0;
  // Increment the loop counter to keep track of how many times the loop has run
  loopcnt++;

  // Nested loops to increment cnt
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
    for (volatile unsigned int j = 0; j < 500; j++) {
      // Increment cnt in the innermost loop
      cnt++;
    }
  }

  // Print the value of cnt and loopcnt to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print(cnt);
  Serial.print(" ");
  Serial.println(loopcnt);

  // Check if cnt is not equal to 250000
  if (cnt != 250000) {
    // If there is a discrepancy, print a glitch message
    Serial.println("<---- GLITCH");
  } else {
    // If cnt equals 250000, do nothing
    Serial.print("");
  }
}
```

### Test Setup

Here is a picture of my test setup, featuring the Arduino Nano mounted on a breadboard, a BBQ lighter, and alligator clips to hold the lighter's leads in place. The Arduino Nano is connected to my laptop via USB without any isolator. It is crucial to keep the spark away from the ATMEGA328P leads or any other connections on the Arduino, as the high voltage could damage both the Arduino and the connected laptop. Although a decoupler can be used to prevent this risk, I did not encounter any issues in my case.

### Testing
Once the Arduino Nano was running and printing to the serial monitor, I began pressing the lighter to create sparks. It faulted on the second attempt! At this time, I was quite happy that I had experienced that the microcontroller faulted so quick and effortless. That's pretty cool! After experimenting with different wire placements, the fault occurred consistently every 3rd to 5th attempt. I also encountered that sometimes the fault would cause the Arduino Nano to reboot.

### Flash Memory Dump
While testing various wire placements and the repeatability of the tests, the serial monitor suddenly began printing a whole bunch of ASCII characters, which was very surprising! Even more surprisingly was that the ASCII characters were recognizable from earlier projects that I used the Arduino Nano for.

Most of the ASCII output was from a Riscure HW hacking CTF (https://github.com/Riscure/Rhme-2016). Specifically, the strings are from the binary/challange called "Casino", which I verified using Ghidra:

### Security Implications
This is quite interesting from a security perspective! It implies that the Arduino does not overwrite all flash memory when a new program is written. I did some research on the Arduino Nano's bootloader and found that it uses either optiboot or ATmegaBOOT [3]. Based on the configuration in the IDE, I know that mine uses ATmegaBOOT. From my research [4][5], it seems highly likely that ATmegaBOOT only erases the pages necessary for the new program data. This means that any previous program data larger than the latest program data written to flash remains persistent and can potentially be recovered.

### Conclusion
Trying out fault injection with the Arduino Nano and a basic BBQ lighter has been really fun. By causing electromagnetic interference near the microcontroller, I saw firsthand how even small disturbances, like sparks from the lighter, can mess with the microcontroller's normal behavior, such as skipping instructions. 

One surprising thing I found was that when I uploaded new programs to the Arduino Nano, not all of the old program's data got erased. Only the parts that the new program needed were cleared out and replaced. This means that bits of old program code could still be hanging around in the microcontroller's memory, which is pretty interesting from a security standpoint.

During my tests, I also noticed that ASCII characters from previous projects suddenly showed up in the output. It made me realize that data from earlier programs can stick around longer than expected, which is something to consider when working on embedded IoT devices.

Overall, this experiment taught me a lot about how susceptible devices like the Arduino Nano are to outside interference. It also showed me the importance of being careful about how data is handled in embedded systems.
