## Introduction
Starting of with a system, either in-development or deployed in the field, the initial approach to securing it, is by performing a security assessment,
this often go by different names such as security risk analysis, threat assessment, risk management or threat modeling. The process I lay out is my  opinion alone and tries to compile the different steps in a way that I like to think about it, and how I have experienced it in a professional setting so far. 

The purpose of this activity, is to provide initial coverage for the scope that is set, we identify threats against the system with the consequences they may lead to,
we then search for  vulnerabilities or system weaknesses that will aid  such threat(s) in potential attacks.
Such an assessment is a top down approach to securing a system, and what this provide is concrete actionables serving
as a decision basis for technical teams, projects or organizations in where to best allocate resources in mitigating unwanted or unacceptable risks to the system.

In short; the objective is to identify threat to the system  and weaknesses that may enable them, and this assessment based on that produces concrete risks that you act upon to mitigate that.
What can happen? How can it happend? Where to place your effort.

### Remarks
The process is meant to be and should be iterative. The quality of the output mirrors the quality of the input, and whatever data that is fed in the assessment will always be a snapshot of the sitation 
at exactly that current point in time. Meaning it is better to reduce the granularity and level of detail of an assessment to ensure that the assessment will be perfomed again. Multiple shallow assessments is preferred over one large painful iteration, especially at the beginning.
The assessor is not meant to have the full knowledge of the system being evaluated. The assessor must include and ensure that subject matter experts are included in most of not all phases of the process.
The assessor should interview the relevant technical teams, architects and developers and facilicate discussion and brainstorming. Ideally the technical teams and SMB's should know enough of the process to intuitively think through the steps themselves, where the asessor should collect and compile the information.
