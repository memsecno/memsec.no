This an introduction post in a series of blog posts related to blockchain security.

## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that allows users and organizations to store and process data with the structured distributed blocks present in a blockchain network. Each new block stores a transaction or a bundle of transactions that is connected to all the previously available blocks in the form of a cryptographic chain. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party [1].

## What is Solidity?
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level programming language used to create smart contracts that automate transactions on the blockchain. After being proposed in 2014, the language was developed by contributors to the Ethereum project. The language is primarily used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and create smart contracts on other blockchains [2].
