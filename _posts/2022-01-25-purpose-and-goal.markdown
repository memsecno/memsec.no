memsec comprises of two security enthusiasts with backgrounds in security and software development, located in Scandinavia.
Aiming to further develop and master the craft of identifying security risks and software faults, our end goal is to better understand and share the impact exposed security vulnerabilities can
have on operational systems and organizations.

Instead of more traditional IT security, memsec's scope in the security realm is on operational technology, modern industry, and "smart" devices deployed out in the field.
