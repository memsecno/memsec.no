memsec is run by three security enthusiasts with backgrounds in security, software development, and electronics aiming to increase our knowledge by sharing with other security enthusiasts. We believe that researching security topics and writing about the experience is the optimal way to learn a topic in-depth, while it also contributes to the InfoSec community. If you want to be a part of the blog or discuss any releated topics, please feel free to get in touch. 

Topics of interests:
 - Application Fuzzing
 - System Assessments

All posts are for learning and educational purposes only.
